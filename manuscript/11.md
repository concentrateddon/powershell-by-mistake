# Problem 11: Argumentative
Try to solve this one without running the code. But, it's okay to look at help files, if you want. Because this one is a long, single line, I'm going to kind of arbitrarily break it up to make it easier to read.

```
Start-Process -FilePath "C:\BootStrap\$($Using:MSIFile.Name)" 
 -ArgumentList "/passive /norestart" 
 -Wait 
 -PassThru 
 ```

This probably won't work. Do you know why?

## Spoiler!
The clue is in the help files for `Start-Process`:

```
Start-Process
     [-FilePath] <String>
     [[-ArgumentList] <String[]>]
     [-WorkingDirectory <String>]
     [-PassThru]
     [-Verb <String>]
     [-WindowStyle <ProcessWindowStyle>]
     [-Wait]
     [<CommonParameters>]
```

As you see here, `-ArgumentList` expects an _array of strings_. We've just given it one string. The `<String[]>` part is the giveaway, with the `[]` indicating that an array of strings is expected. We'd type that as a comma-separated list, and PowerShell would convert those to an array for us. So, like this, right?

```
-ArgumentList "/passive,/norestart"
```

Nope! With the comma inside the quotes, we're still passing a single string. We need this:

```
-ArgumentList "/passive","/norestart"
```

Where the comma _separates_ two distinct strings. So that's probably better. More specifically, Example 7 in the help file shows exactly this usage, highlighting how important it is to explore those help files!
