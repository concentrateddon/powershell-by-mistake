# Problem 16: Shall I Compare Theeâ€¦
Consider:

```
$string = "11/28/2018"
$string1 = Get-Date $string -Hour 00 -Minute 00 -Second 00
$string2 = Get-Date -Hour 00 -Minute 00 -Second 00
$string1.ToString() -ge $string2.ToString()
```

This works as-expected. The following, however, does not:

```
$string = "11/28/2018"
$string1 = Get-Date $string -Hour 00 -Minute 00 -Second 00
$string2 = Get-Date -Hour 00 -Minute 00 -Second 00
$string1 -ge $string2
```

How come?

## Spoiler!! 
What PowerShell displays on the screen after you run a command is the result of a complex formatting system, meaning the actual objects produced by the command might not be visible to you. For example, the object produced by `Get-Date` has a milliseconds property which isn't ordinarily displayed. So even a straightforward comparison:

```
(Get-Date) -eq (Get-Date)
```

That'll return False sometimes, because a millisecond elapses between the first `Get-Date` executing and the second one running. So to walk through our "failing" example:

```
$string = "11/28/2018"
```

Our variable now contains a date-only string. PowerShell can parse that into a proper DateTime object:

```
$string1 = Get-Date $string -Hour 00 -Minute 00 -Second 00
```

But this isn't a "full resolution" DateTime, so the millisecond property is unknown.

```
$string2 = Get-Date -Hour 00 -Minute 00 -Second 00
```

We've produced what SHOULD be today's date, but, again, we've missed the milliseconds.

```
$string1 -ge $string2
```

And so we get unexpected output. Always remember: _what you see on the screen isn't necessarily the truth_. Always pipe things to `fl *` and `gm` to make sure you're seeing the _fully real thing_ in front of your weak organic eyeballs.
