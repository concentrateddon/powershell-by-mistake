# Problem 10: True Equality
Here's the code - spot the problem!

```
do {
   get-aduser -filter * | select SamAccountName | ForEach-Object {
   
   if ($_.SamAccountName -eq $username) {
   $username = $firstname+($lastname.Substring(0,$i))
   
   $i++
   write-host $username
   }
   else {
   $usernameexists = $false
   
   }
  }
}
until ($usernameexists = $false)

Write-Host "Username is $username" -ForegroundColor Green
```

## Spoiler!!
Did you catch it? Being able to statically read code and find a problem is a really key skill, one that takes years, sometimes, to really build up to.

```
until ($usernameexists = $false)
```

That's the problem. SO easy to make, and one I made a LOT in the early days of PowerShell when I was switching from VBScript. You see, `=` isn't an equality operator in PowerShell, it's an assignment operator. The equality operator is `-eq`:

```
until ($usernameexists -eq $false)
```

Or, if you know `$usernameexists` will always be True or False:

```
until (-not $usernameexists)
```

Fun trivia: the reason PowerShell uses `-gt` and similar operators, versus the more traditional `<` and such, is because Microsoft wanted to use `>` for redirection, like shells commonly do. It was difficult to get the parser to understand that sometimes `>` meant redirection and other times it meant "less than," and so they switched to a different syntax for operators. Pretty much all comparison operators now start with a `-` in PowerShell.
