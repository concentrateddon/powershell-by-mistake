# Problem 4
The following is a snippet; a more complete code example is available in the GitHub repo described in the front matter to this book. The stated problem with this code is that, while it basically works fine (well, the complete version does), the email alerts never contain the error message desired.

```
   
Import-Module ActiveDirectory 

$Smtpserver = "smtpmail.domain.com"
$From = "noreply@domain.com"
$To = "user@domain.com"
$Subject = "Delete Stale Computers Failed"
$Body = "The Delete Stale computers script failed due to error '$($errormessage)'.   One of the OU's listed maybe missing in Active Directory.  Please review the list of OU's and check if they are still present in Active Directory" 

$date = [DateTime]::Today.AddDays(-180)

$ous = @('OU=Name,DC=domain,DC=com')


Get-AdComputer -Properties LastLogonDate -Filter {LastLogonDate -le $date} -Searchbase $_ 

        
if ($error[0].exception.message.Contains("Directory object not found")) {
            $errormessage = $error[0].exception.message.ToLower()
            Send-MailMessage -SmtpServer $Smtpserver -From $From -To $To -Subject $Subject -BodyAsHtml $Body
            $error.Clear()                   
        }
```

You can see where the error message variable is included in the email body:

```
$Body = "The Delete Stale computers script failed due to error '$($errormessage)'.   One of the OU's listed maybe missing in Active Directory.  Please review the list of OU's and check if they are still present in Active Directory" 
```

And you can see where $errormessage is being populated:

```
$errormessage = $error[0].exception.message.ToLower()
```

So that's the problem?

## Spoiler!
PowerShell uses double quotation marks as "magic quotes." In programming languages that support magic quotes, the language scans for variables or subexpressions, and replaces them with whatever they evaluate to:

```
PS C:\> $a = 'Hello'
PS C:\> $b = "$a, World'
PS C:\> $b
Hello, World
```

There are two ways that languages implement magic quotes, which I personally call "eager" and "lazy." In an "eager" language, _the contents of the string are evaluated and replaced when you define the string_. In a "lazy" language, this happens when the string is _retrieved_. 

PowerShell is an "eager" language. This means that it tried to insert `$errormessage` waaaay at the top of the script, rather than after `$errormessage` had been populated. The fix here is to move the email body definition:

```
if ($error[0].exception.message.Contains("Directory object not found")) {
            $errormessage = $error[0].exception.message.ToLower()
            $Body = "The Delete Stale computers script failed due to error '$($errormessage)'.   One of the OU's listed maybe missing in Active Directory.  Please review the list of OU's and check if they are still present in Active Directory" 
            Send-MailMessage -SmtpServer $Smtpserver -From $From -To $To -Subject $Subject -BodyAsHtml $Body
            $error.Clear()                   
        }
```

This can seem inefficient, because you're constantly re-defining the string, but that's the way you _have_ to do it in PowerShell. I mean, there are some other syntactic ways you could get to the same place of "I have to create a new string every time," but you'll still end up in that place.
