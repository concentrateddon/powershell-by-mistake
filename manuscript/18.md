# Problem 18: Literally the Registry
Here's the code:

```
function Test-RegistryValue {
 param (
  [parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
  [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]$Path,
  [parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
  [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]$Name
 )
 try {
  Get-ItemProperty -Path $Path `
                   -Name $Name `
                   -ErrorAction Stop | 
  Out-Null
  return $true
 } catch {
  return $false
 }
}
```

Now, here's that command in use, and it'll generate the wrong results:

```
Test-RegistryValue -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Misc\*" `
-Name "test"
```

The asterisk is deliberate; the example presumes that there is a key named \SOFTWARE\Misc\*. So what's wrong?

## Spoiler!!
The problem with using a "file system" paradigm for things other than the file system is that certain characters in the actual file system, like `?` and `*`, are illegal, and used for special purposes; elsewhere, however, those characters are perfectly legal and shouldn't be treated as special.

The trick here is this:

```
  Get-ItemProperty -Path $Path `
                   -Name $Name `
                   -ErrorAction Stop | 
```

Should be this:

```
  Get-ItemProperty -LiteralPath $Path `
                   -Name $Name `
                   -ErrorAction Stop | 
```

The `-LiteralPath` parameter forces all characters to be treated as literals, not as special wildcards. My other suggestion with this function is to change this:

```
  return $true
```

And the following `return $false` to be:

```
  Write $True
```

And, of course, `Write $False`. The `return` keyword, in anything but a v5+ class, is misleading. It doesn't do what `return` in literally any other language does, and including it suggests that the person using it isn't aware of PowerShell's somewhat inimical use of `return`, meaning they're likely to get caught in a common "gotcha."
