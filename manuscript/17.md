# Problem 17: Debug Me
Just start with this code:

```
$Userdata = Import-Csv C:\empID.csv
ForEach ($User in $Userdata) {
  $User = $User.User 
  $Department = $Department.Department
  Get-ADUser -Filter "EmployeeNumber -eq '$User'" -Properties * |
  set-AdUser -Add "'$User' -eq 'Department'"  -Properties Department
}
```

That's also in the downloadable code samples.

There are three main problems. Can you spot them?

## Spoiler!!
First off, the ForEach loop is using `$User` as its enumerator variable, but then immediately overwriting that:

```
ForEach ($User in $Userdata) {
  $User = $User.User 
```

The `$User` variable is no longer a single item from $Userdata, which messes up the code a bit further down. Second is this:

```
$Department = $Department.Department
```

The `$Department` variable is undefined to this point; it's probably meant to be:

```
$Department = $User.Department
```

Presuming that `$User` had not been improperly overwritten as noted previously. A correct version might be:

```
$Userdata = Import-Csv C:\empID.csv
ForEach ($User in $Userdata) {
  $User2 = $User.User 
  $Department = $User.Department
  Get-ADUser -Filter "EmployeeNumber -eq '$User2'" -Properties * |
  set-AdUser -Add "'$User2' -eq 'Department'"  -Properties Department
}
```

Except that the `-Add` parameter is being used improperly. This is probably correct:

```
Set-ADUser -Department $Department
```

Did you get them all?
